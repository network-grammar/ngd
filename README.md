# Network Grammar Demonstrator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/network-grammar/ngd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/network-grammar/ngd)

First attempt at an implementation of Richard Harber's "Network Grammar" theory, as described at <http://www.languidslog.com/>.  
This demo will only cover a small toy language, with a manually built lexicon.
